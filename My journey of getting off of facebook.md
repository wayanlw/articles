# There was a time

There was a time that I was a social butterfly. When I was experiencing some memorable events in my life, I was constantly thinking "How would this look like in my Facebook feed?" "What would people think when I share this in FB/IG" etc. Some times I was missing what is happening in front of my eyes. Because, my mind was somewhere else.

There was a time that I used to publish most of my GOOD memorable moments in social media. And then I was constantly checking it to see what other people are saying. Whether they are liking, commenting.
