# How I minimize my dependancy on Tech

In my previous articles " Your data online is not your anymore" I highlighted three important lessesons that I learnt.

1. Expect the worst case
2. Backup, Backup, Backup
3. Have substitute services for main tech services

In this article I am going to share what I am doing in each of these areas.

## Expect the worst case
This is a state of mind that we have to have. Point 2 and 3 should be executed keeping this in mind. Basically, I assume any service that I dpeend on can vanish tomorrow, and I try to get ready for that

## Backup, Backup, Backup

### Mobile
At least once in 6 months, I reset my personal mobile phone to factory settings wiping all data. This is done without any planning, to simulate an actual lost phone. I usually don't use my phone very much so my dpendancy on my phone is relatively low. However,

#### Contacts
I maintain my contacts in my google account. So it is synced with my mobile in real-time. However, after the yahoo incident, I decided to keep a offline backup of my contacts. Almost all the services allow you to export your contacts to a CSV file. Remember to save this file with the date in the filename, so that if ever the need arises to restore, you can easily identify the latest version.

#### SMS and Call Log
The importance of SMS and Call log varies from person to person. Since, I dont use Whats App on my phone and not all people are on Signal still, SMS is important for me. So keeping a backup is required. Simillarly, there has been many instances where I recalled different incidents based on my call log. So that too is important.

I use an app called "SMS backup and restore" to backup my SMS and calllog to a folder in my phone. This app has the ability to make scheduled backups. And I have setup this folder to sync with my computers using syncthing. So my SMS's and call logs are always backedup.

### Photos & Videos
This is one of my primary uses of my mobile phone. I use Google Photos to sync all my photos to google cloud in real time. In June last year, google stopped offering its FREE storage for synced photos. However, they continued to offer free storage for "High Quality" photos uploaded from a Google Pixel phone. For this reason, I bought two Pixel phones for me and for my wife. With the partner sharing features, both of our Google Photos accounts are synced. So all the photos that any of us take is synced (hence backed up) to Google Photos.

In addition to that, I have synced the photos folder in my phone to my computer using syncthing.

### Note taking
I have three types of notetaking.
1. Structure long term learning. Eg. following a course
2. Note taking related to quick finds. Eg. Simillar to a slipbox in zettlekastin note taking method
3. quick long term note snippets. Eg. Address of a friends, phone number of a contact that I dont want to save to my contacts etc.

Structured


### Documents
Important documets are scanned using the mobile ( I use CamScanner or microsoft lens) and filed immediately against a cloud storage. I have a setup folder structure in my cloud and every scan will have a place to be filed immediately.

Not so important documents. (Eg. Warranty, payment receipt) - Thease are filed with evrenote using the app [Scannable](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/evernote-scannable/id883338188).
